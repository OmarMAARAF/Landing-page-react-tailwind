<h1>React Landing Page</h1>
<p>This is a landing page built using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and styled using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To run this app locally, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> (optional, but recommended)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running the App Locally</h2>
<p>To get started using the app on your own machine, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed on your machine.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by opening a terminal window and running the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/OmarMAARAF/Landing-page-react-tailwind
</pre>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
npm install
</pre>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
npm start
</pre>
<p>This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser. You can now make changes to the code and see the updates live in the browser.</p>
<p>To build the app for production, run the following command:</p>
<pre>
npm run build
</pre>
<p>This will create a production-ready build of the app in the <code>build</code> directory. You can then serve the app using a static file server such as serve or deploy it to a hosting platform like GitHub Pages.</p>
